			We all wanna die, we're meeseeks! Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty.
			Just you and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why,
			Morty? Because he crossed me. I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe For Concentrated Dark
			Matter for a crowd this tiny! You can run, but you can't hide bitch! Isn't it obvious Morty? I froze him. It's
			a dream, Morty! We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your
			pants, we-we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside Snuffles' dream.

			Yo! What up my glip glops! It probably has space aids. I mean, why would a poptart want to live inside a
			toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? Hi! I'm Mr
			Meeseeks! Look at me! It's like the N word and the C word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words
			for Jews. A price for everything.

			Go home and drink, grandpa. You don't know me! It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the speed
			of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like
			Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Listen to your sister
			Morty; to live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting
			wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much of that did you hear? I
			am Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 schmeckles! Pluto's a planet.
